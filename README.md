# clicky-game

## Getting Started

Head to the github pages site and you’re off to the races.

### How it Works

This is a matching game that tests if you can remember what you’ve clicked. Click a fun and exciting picture from the internet and and the results will shuffle themselves so you can click another picture. Click all the pictures without repeating to get the highest possible score!

### Prerequisites

Working knowledge of a computer, use of keyboard/mouse. If you’re reading this, I’d image you’re in good shape.

### Installing

No installation necessary.

## Built With

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – The Microsoft Word of the coding world
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) – It runs in the browser, what’s not to love
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) – In case you want hundreds of thousands of dependencies for your four-file website
* [react]( https://reactjs.org/) – reload the whole page? What is this 2012?

## Contributing

Prove your mettle by matching all the pictures and I’ll recognize your skill by entertaining your inputs.
